# Installation
*This plugin requires IPA which you will automatically get if you install [the Song Loader Plugin](https://github.com/xyonico/BeatSaberSongInjector/releases).*

1. Make sure that Beat Saber is not running.
2. Extract the `CameraPlus.dll` into the `Beat Saber/Plugins folder`.  
	For Oculus Home: `.../Oculus Apps/Software/hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber`  
	For Steam: `.../steamapps/common/Beat Saber`
		(The folder that contains Beat Saber.exe)
4. Done! You've installed the CameraPlus Plugin.

# Usage
After you run the game once, a `cameraplus.cfg` file is created within the Beat Saber folder.
Edit that file to configure CameraPlus:

`fov=90.0` The horizontal field of view of the camera.  
`positionSmooth=10.0` How much position should smooth **SMALLER NUMBER = SMOOTHER**  
`rotationSmooth=5.0` How much rotation should smooth **SMALLER NUMBER = SMOOTHER**

The game updates the camera as soon as you save the config file.
